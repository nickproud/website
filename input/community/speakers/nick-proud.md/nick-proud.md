Iâ€™m a senior software engineer, Microsoft MVP and technology leader working within the RPA space, delivering software that enhances day-to-day processes.
I create videos about C# and .NET on YouTube and I am currently the Head of Software Development at NexBotix

I love .NET as it has such a rapid pace of development, and I'm always eager to learn more. I was the kid who always wanted to break things down to the constituent parts and then I was so excited about what I found that I told everyone, whether they cared or not!

I continue in this same vein, by teaching people how they can leverage .NET to solve complex problems, and grow as an engineer.
